{"name":"Integration von Doctrine DBAL in TYPO3 CMS","tagline":"Web applications are often developed around one particular database management system. In the past MySQL was used a lot. To decouple the web application from this dependency you could use the database abstraction layer PDO, which is bundled with PHP. Doctrine DBAL goes one step further which offers, based on PDO, a unified interface to a broad range of other database management systems. Additionally Doctrine DBAL is the base of Doctrine ORM – a framework for object-relational database mapping, which is used by TYPO3 Flow and TYPO3 Neos. This paper demonstrates how to decouple the dependency to MySQL by integrating Doctrine DBAL into the content manangement system TYPO3 CMS. On top of that it implements an abstract query language for the underlying database with the choice to use Prepared Statements.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
